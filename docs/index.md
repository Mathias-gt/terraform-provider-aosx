# Terraform RESTCONF Provider

The Terraform AOS-X RESTCONF provider allows you to manage configuration of Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise OmniSwitch using the RESTCONF API.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x or later
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 or later (to build the provider plugin)
- [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) (optional, for building releases)
- [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation) (optional, for debugging)

## Building the Provider

1. Clone the provider repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathias-gt/terraform-provider-aosx
```

2. Change into the repository directory:

```bash
cd terraform-provider-aosx
```

3. Build the provider binary:

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-aosx
```

4. Move the provider binary to the Terraform plugins directory:

For Terraform 0.12.x and earlier, you can put the provider binary in the same directory as your Terraform configuration files or in the user plugins directory, which is usually `~/.terraform.d/plugins` on UNIX-like systems and `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins` on Windows.

## Building Releases with GoReleaser

To build releases using GoReleaser, follow these steps:

1. Install GoReleaser:

```bash
curl -sL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser.sh | sh
```

2. Configure your `.goreleaser.yml` file to define the build settings and artifacts.

3. Run GoReleaser to build the release artifacts:

```bash
goreleaser --rm-dist
```

## Debugging with Delve and Visual Studio Code

1. Install Delve:

Follow the [Delve installation guide](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation) for your platform.

2. Configure Visual Studio Code:

- Install the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) for Visual Studio Code.

3. Start debugging:
- Set a breakpoint in the code where you want to debug.
- Open the Visual Studio Code command palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the "Debug: Start Debugging" command.
- DLV will output the debug command such as:
```
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"https://github.com/Mathias-gt/terraform-provider-aosx":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":86798,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/9c/cw8hxtyj4fz2kfmglh82g0s80000gq/T/plugin1217677869"}}}'
```
- Copy the command and paste it into your terminal
- Run terraform plan or apply
- The debugger will stop at the breakpoint you set
